# MangaReader
It's an image browser for PC. Kinda old fashion but I love it.

### Why bother?
Other reader on PC is either clunky or ugly. So one day I figure why not try building one myself..


### Features
 - UI of a clean manga website
 - Smooth mouse input
 - Thumbs up your favorite
 - Mini directory navigator
 - and a billion QoL

# WIP
### WIP
 - search / tag / filter (cmd only for now)

### Idea
 - better navigation when local library gets HUGE
 - some hack-ish web capability would be nice?  ->  either directly from web, or cloud drive / server (so you don't have to maintain the library locally)
 - faster async loading  <-  maybe it's C++ time?

### Tsukkomi
 - WPF didn't make it easy for dual monitors... to the point of adding Windows.Form ref
 - if I start again, I'd explore some different framework... something modern and maybe support more platforms
 - MAUI seems nice?
 - if a config UI is only used once per 100 years, ditch the UI and put it in a xml...

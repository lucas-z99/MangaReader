# MangaReader
Kinda old fashion, but I love it.

About:
 - Minimalist
 - Vertically arrange images, just like a good manga website
 - Mouse do everything
 - Thumbs up
 - Dual monitors
 - Mini folder navigator

WIP:
 - search / add tag / filter when navigating (cmd only currently)
 - need a beter navigation system when library gets HUGE (a folder navigator shows 1st pic of all folders?)

Tsukkomi:
 - WPF didn't make it easy for multi-monitor...
 - If I start again, I'd choose a better framework... something modern and maybe support more platforms
 - MAUI seems nice and convient, but keyboard/mouse support maybe bit concerning?

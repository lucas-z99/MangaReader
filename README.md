# MangaReader
Kinda old fashion, but I love it.

About:
 - Like any good manga websites, but minimalist
 - Mouse do everything
 - Thumbs up
 - Mini folder navigator

WIP:
 - search / add tag / filter when navigating (cmd only currently)
 - need a beter navigation system when library gets HUGE (a folder navigator shows 1st pic of all folders?)

Tsukkomi:
 - WPF didn't make it easy for dual monitors...
 - if I start again, I'd choose a better framework... something modern and maybe support more platforms. MAUI seems nice?
 - if a config is only used once per 100 years, put them in a xml, or hire someone to do the config UI

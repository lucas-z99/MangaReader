# MangaReader
Kinda old fashion, but I love it.

About:
 - Image browser. Minimalist, like any good manga websites
 - Mouse do everything
 - Thumbs up
 - Drop file / Mini directory navigator

WIP:
 - search / add tag / filter (cmd only currently)

Idea:
 - beter navigation when local library gets HUGE
 - some hack-ish web capability would be nice?  ->  either directly from web, or cloud drive / server (so you don't have to maintain the library locally)
 - faster async loading  <-  maybe it's C++ time?

Tsukkomi:
 - WPF didn't make it easy for dual monitors...
 - if I start again, I'd choose a better framework... something modern and maybe support more platforms. MAUI seems nice?
 - if a config is only used once per 100 years, put them in a xml, or hire someone to do the config UI
